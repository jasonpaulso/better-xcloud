# Better xCloud
Improve [Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud)](https://www.xbox.com/play/) experience on web browser.  
The main target of this script is mobile users, but it should work great on desktop too.

Give this project a üåü if you like it. Thank you üôè.

<sup>(\*)</sup> By default (for compatibility reasons) xCloud only uses high quality codec profile when you use Tizen TV or Chrome/Edge/Chromium browser on Chrome/MacOS. Enable this setting will give you the best experience no matter what platform & browser you're on.

## How to use
1. Install [Tampermonkey extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) on suppported browsers. It's also available for Firefox on Android.
2. Install **Better xCloud**:
    - [Stable version](https://github.com/redphx/better-xcloud/releases/latest/download/better-xcloud.user.js)
    - [Dev version](https://github.com/redphx/better-xcloud/raw/main/better-xcloud.user.js)  
4. Refresh [xCloud web page](https://www.xbox.com/play/).
5. Click on the new "SERVER NAME" button next to your profile picture to adjust settings.  
6. Don't forget to enable auto updating for the script in Tampermonkey.

To update manually, just install the script again (you won't lose your settings).

Don't see your browser in the table? If it supports Tampermonkey/Userscript then the answer is likely **"YES"**.

<sup>1</sup> Follow [this guide](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/find-and-install-add-ons-firefox-android) to install Tampermonkey on Firefox Android. Its Gamepad API doesn't work properly so it might not recognize your controller.  
<sup>2, 3</sup> Requires [Userscripts app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887) (free & open source).  
<sup>4</sup> NOT RECOMMENDED at the moment since its Userscript implementation is not working properly (see https://github.com/redphx/better-xcloud/issues/5 for full details).

- **Kiwi Browser** is the best choice on Android. All features work, it means you can get 1080p stream + high quality codec profile (the best possible quality).  
- **Better xCloud** also works on Android TV, but you'll have to sideload the browser APK and need a bluetooth mouse if you want to interact with the Settings.  

## FAQ
1. **Will I get banned for using this?**  
I think it's very unlikely that you'll get banned for using this. Most of the features only affect client-side, except for switching region of streaming server (you'll connect to another server instead of the default one). If you want to be safe just avoid using that. As always, use as your own risk.

2. **Why is it an Userscript and not extension?**  
It's because not many browsers on Android support installing extensions (and not all extensions can be installed).

3. **I see "???" button instead of server's name**  
That means Tampermonkey is not working properly. Please make sure you're using the latest version or switch to a well-known browser.  

4. **Can I use this with the Xbox Android app?**  
No you can't. You'll have to modify the app.

5. **Will you able to enable "Clarity Boost" feature on non-Edge browsers?**  
No. "Clarity Boost" feature uses an exclusive API (`Video.msVideoProcessing`) that's only available on Edge browser for desktop at the moment.

## User-Agent
You're no longer needed to change User-Agent since you can just use the **Force high quality stream** setting.  
If your browser doesn't support **Force high quality stream** setting, try changing User-Agent to:  
```
Mozilla/5.0 (SMART-TV; LINUX; Tizen 7.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) 94.0.4606.31/7.0 TV Safari/537.36
```
This will change your device to a Samsung TV running Tizen OS. It will improve the stream quality.  

---
Change User-Agent to:
```
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/114.0.1823.67
```
This will trick xCloud into thinking you're using Edge browser on desktop.

Other options (only do one of these):
- Add ` smarttv` to switch to Smart TV layout.
- Add ` Xbox;` to become an Xbox console.
- Add ` 36102dd3-6953-45f6-8b48-031fb95e0e0d` to become a Logitech G Cloud device.
- Add ` 0ed22b6f-b61d-41eb-810a-a1ed586a550b` to become a Razer Edge device.
