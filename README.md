# Better xCloud
Improve Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) experience on [xbox.com/play](https://www.xbox.com/play). It also allows you to use Remote Play on the xCloud website.  

**Supported platforms:**  
- Windows
- macOS
- Linux, SteamOS (Steam Deck)
- Android, Android TV
- iOS, iPadOS

This script makes me spend more time with xCloud, and I hope the same thing happens to you.  
If you like this project please give it a üåü. Thank you üôè.

## How to install
1. Install an userscript extension:
   - **Safari**: Install [Userscripts extension](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887). Check [this page](https://github.com/redphx/better-xcloud/wiki/Using-with-Safari) before using.
   - **All other browsers**: Install [Tampermonkey extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).  
3. Install **Better xCloud**:
    - [Stable version](https://github.com/redphx/better-xcloud/releases/latest/download/better-xcloud.user.js)
    <!-- - [Dev version](https://github.com/redphx/better-xcloud/raw/main/better-xcloud.user.js)-->  
    I only distribute **Better xCloud** on GitHub, *DO NOT* download it on other websites or from unknown sources.
4. Refresh the [xCloud web page](https://www.xbox.com/play/).
5. Click on the new *\<SERVER NAME\>* button next to your profile picture to adjust settings.

To update manually, just install the script again (you won't lose your settings).

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è If you're using Kiwi Browser on Android, make sure to follow the steps correctly and install the script with Tampermonkey (not installing it as an extension), or else it won't work.

## Compatibility
- üëç = best choice, all features work as intended
- ‚úÖ = confirmed to be working, might miss some features
- ‚ùå = not supported (mostly because of lacking Userscript/extension support)
- ‚ûñ = unavailable
- üóíÔ∏è = see custom notes

Don't see your browser in the table? If it supports Tampermonkey/Userscript then the answer is likely **"YES"**.

<sup>1</sup> Follow [this guide](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/find-and-install-add-ons-firefox-android) to install Tampermonkey on Firefox Android. Its Gamepad API doesn't work properly so it might not recognize your controller.  
<sup>2, 3</sup> Requires [Userscripts app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887) (free & open-source). Check [this page](https://github.com/redphx/better-xcloud/wiki/Using-with-Safari) before using.  

---
- **Kiwi Browser** is the best choice on Android. All features work, it means you can get 1080p stream + high-quality codec profile (the best possible quality).  
- **Better xCloud** also works on Android TV, but you'll have to sideload the browser APK and need a Bluetooth mouse if you want to interact with the Settings.

- **üî• Touch controller**
  > Enable touch controller support for all games.

### Server

  > Connect to another server instead of the default one.  
  > It's not using VPN.  
  > ["Can I get banned for using this?"](#faq)  
- **Preferred game's language**
  > If the game doesn't support this language, it will use the same language as xCloud's website.  
- **Prefer IPv6 server**

  > More shortcuts will be added later.

### Advanced features  
- **Change User-Agent**
  > Useful when you're using unsupported browsers.  
  > This setting only affects xCloud, and it doesn't change browser's global User-Agent.  
  > üìù If you get 404 error after using this feature, try refreshing the page a few times. See [#34](https://github.com/redphx/better-xcloud/issues/34).  
- **Hide footer and other UI elements**

<sup>(\*)</sup> By default (for compatibility reasons) xCloud only uses high quality codec profile when you use Tizen TV or Chrome/Edge/Chromium browser on Chrome/MacOS. Enable this setting will give you the best experience no matter what platform & browser you're on.

## Stream stats

This info is provided by WebRTC API. You can use browser's built-in tool to see more info:  
- Chrome/Edge/Chromium variants: `chrome://webrtc-internals`  
- Firefox: `about:webrtc`

Colors:  
- Red = Bad
- Yellow = Okay
- Green = Good
- White = Great

‚ö†Ô∏è Having this info on all the time will drain the battery faster, so I'd recommend only using it when having network problems.  

## Capture screenshot  
- This feature is only available in **Better xCloud**.  
- Works on both desktop & mobile, but it was designed for mobile users.
- It's client-side only.
- It captures the current frame of the stream and saves it to a file. That means you won't get the raw quality like when you play on a console, but it's still better than using the built-in screenshot feature on your phone.  
- Screenshot's resolution & quality depend on the quality of the stream at the moment.  
- Screenshot doesn't include touch UI, notification bar... only the gameplay.  
- There might be a slight delay.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è It's not possible to map the Share/Screenshot button on your controller to this feature.  

### How to capture screenshot  
1. Enable this feature in the Settings.
2. Play a game.
3. Tap once at the bottom left/right (depending on your setting) to show the Screenshot button.
4. Tap on that button to capture screenshot.
5. Screenshot will be saved by the browser.
6. You can double-tap that corner to capture screenshot.

## FAQ
1. **Will I get banned for using this?**  
I think it's very unlikely that you'll get banned for using this. Most of the features only affect client-side, except for switching region of streaming server (you'll connect to another server instead of the default one). If you want to be safe just avoid using that. As always, use it as your own risk.

2. **Why is it an Userscript and not an extension?**  
It's because not many browsers on Android support installing extensions (and not all extensions can be installed).

3. **Why doesn't the xCloud website implement *this* or *that* feature from Better xCloud?**  
Think of this project as an unofficial beta version of xCloud.  
    - **Better xCloud** doesn't have to worry about the compatibility much: if it doesn't work on this browser, it can just suggest you switch to another one. xCloud can't do the same.  
    - On the xCloud's side, they have a lot more users and devices to support, so it's more difficult for them to implement a new feature.  
    - Also, it's not easy to explain some of the features of **Better xCloud** to normal xCloud users.  

4. **Can I use this with the Xbox Android app?**  
No, you can't. You'll have to modify the app.

5. **Will it be able to enable the "Clarity Boost" feature on non-Edge browsers?**  
~~No. The "Clarity Boost" feature uses an exclusive API (`Video.msVideoProcessing`) that's only available on Edge browser for desktop at the moment.~~  
Fake news! This feature has been implemented in **Better xCloud** since version 1.12, but the original "Clarity Boost" still perform better.  

7. **Will it be able to request a lower FPS or increase the maximum bitrate (15Mbps) of the stream?**  
Sorry, no. The server decides all these settings.

8. **What's the meaning behind the name "Better xCloud"?**  
It's a reference to an Userscript called "better360" that I created many years ago. I regret not choosing the name "xCloud Enhancement Suite", or XES for short.
